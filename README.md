# 🌙 Lailatul Coding - Color Contrast Checker

Welcome to Color Contrast Checker 👀🎨, a project born from the sacred hustle of Lailatul Coding—an internal Mayar team Ramadan hackathon where caffeine and code collide. This tool helps you ensure your website's color contrast is on point, following [WCAG accessibility standards](https://www.wcag.com/solutions/why-contrast-checkers-matter-for-web-accessibility/). Because inclusivity? We stan. 💙
